# TermiBudget

TermiBudget is a terminal-based personal finance manager written in C++. It lets users track their income, expenses, savings goals, and monthly budgets directly from the command line. Users can create profiles, add transactions with categories and tags, set recurring bills, and monitor their spending progress with ASCII-style visual bars. All data is saved locally using file I/O, and users can export their transaction history to CSV format. The project uses modern C++ (C++17), object-oriented design, and STL containers like vectors and maps to manage data. Itâ€™s a simple, fast, and clean way to take control of your finances through code. To run it, clone the repo, compile with g++, and launch the executable. This project was built to demonstrate strong C++ fundamentals while solving a real-world problem in a lightweight, offline environment.
